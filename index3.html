        <h2>Digital Methods, Skills and Resources</h2>
        <p>Digital project management is about streamlining the process of overseeing a project from inception to development and research all the way to completion. This would involve delegating, tracking and following through on broken down tasks, encompassing budgeting, reviewing and measuring successes and failures. Organisational and research skills are essential for the development of digital projects, as these initial steps in building a wider project will be the building blocks of everything.

            That being said, there are plenty of tools and methods that can be used to help the process run more smoothly. For example, using Kanban principles is a simple and effective way to begin a large scale project. The first rule of Kanban planning is to break down bigger actions into doable tasks to increase productivity. These are then organised into a board structure, whereby you use three columns to describe tasks that need doing, are in progress and those that have been completed.
            
            There are a plethora of online tools that can help you to carry this out at optimal efficiency. One of these tools is Trello, which is an online space that you can add tasks to different lists, implementing Kanban principles if you wanted to. There are also various integrated calendar applications, including iCal and Google Calendar that can sync between your desktop and handheld devices.</p>

        <h2>The Risks That Affect Digital Projects</h2>
        <p>One of the first risks one must consider when approaching a digital project is data protection. Digital projects often require the use of third party tools and resources for communication and organisation, including the aforementioned Slack and Trello, so as a business, you must be aware of the risks posed to your project through these systems. Some of these more integrated sysems, such as servers and file space, will also pose a financial burden to your company and you must assess what level of tools are required to make your project work. 

            Often, a risk of group endeavours is that there will be a lot of stakeholders with access to different privilege levels. It's paramount that these are thought through, so that you don't end up with a "too many cooks" situation.  Editing who has access to what information can stop this for happening and is an essential way to maintain productivity. 
            
            Furthermore, something that should be considered is how you will keep organisation up to date. Again, this may be something you chosoe to designate, rather than allow everyone to add to it. Something else you may consider along this vein is how you will keep engagement levels consistently high to ensure maximum efficiency. Will you have the funds and resources to make this a separate position or will it again need to be delegated amongst your current workforce? These are all important risk factors that may harm your organisation in the long run if you don't address them as soon as possible.</p>

        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>Accessibility is a huge problem in our current digital landscape. It should be at the forefront of our design implementations, however, it often ends up being an afterthought. It is commonly viewed as something that requires lots of time, money and effort, but there are really simple ways of making webpages more accessible and widening your target audience in a mutually beneficial manner. 

          Firstly, using a dyslexia friendly font is a bare minimum for a webpage, as sans serif fonts have easier readability for dyslexic users. Around 1/5 people have dyslexia in the UK, so by using an easier to digest font, you are making the most of your market and valuing your clients. Even for the populace that does not have dyslexia, it makes sense to optimise your webpage so it's easily readable in different levels of lighting. Furthermore, using an off-white background as opposed to white can be helpful in this regard too. In terms of colour palette, this can also be catered for colourblind people by using a monochromatic or highly contrasting array of colours. 
          
          Secondly, a massive part of webpage accessibility lies in its ability to function for users who are visually impaired. Nowadays, many devices have inbuilt functionality for this, including speak and guided access functions, so all that is required from a development standpoint is to cater to the hardware. Just writing a piece of descriptive copy to go alongside your images can go a long way to making your users feel included. </p>

        <h2>Website File Types</h2>
        <p>The filetypes you may use for websites fall into a couple of essential types, with others being used as catalysts for other functions your site may possess (ie downloads). 

          Firstly, for the raw content of a page, HTML is used. An HTML file can be viewed straight through your browser and is unlikely to have any style added to it. CSS files are what will add this visual flair to your website. A few different image types may be used for display purposes, including still images like JPG/JPEG or PNG, the latter of which is larger and of higher quality. You may even use a GIF format for moving images. Downloads are usually presented in the form of EXE files which users can click on to begin the download process.

        <h2>Copyright</h2>
        <p>Copyright is a very serious issue online, as people often overlook that media needs to be sourced properly as it's so easy to procure and save to your computer to be reshared. Larger brands are more likely to be able to afford to be copyrighted, meaning that they will be able to easily prosecute anyone that infringes on this, but theft of intellectual property is also illegal, it's just harder to carry out realistically if you're starting out or own a small business.

          To avoid impinging on someone else's work, it's good practice to always properly cite and source any third party media and to make sure it isn't copyrighted. There are plenty of websites where you can source royalty free pictures and music and Google Images even has a search function that allows you to find images that are allowed to be repurposed for commercial and non-commercial use. All in all, it's just good sense to copyright things like logos or anything innovative, as well as properly sourcing media, asking the proprietor for permission where possible.</p>

        <h2>The Legal Aspect </h2>
        <p>The main framework for assessing the legal constraints of digital projects are the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) guidelines, released by the EU in 2018. These are a set of rules that affect how data can be used and shared lawfully and can result in heavy fines if not properly considered by businesses.

        There are seven main guidelines to GDPR, chronicling individuals rights to where and how their data is held. The first of these is the right to access. This means that any individual has the right to know exactly what information a company has about them. This way, people can find out if a company has more information on them that they would like or than that is necessary for the service they are providing. In this vein, the second right is the right to rectification, which basically means a person is allowed to change their information to be correct, for example, if they change numbers or move house.</p>
