        <h2>The Purpose of IT in Modern Business</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Having a background in marketing and writing has made me realise the impact that technology has in the modern workplace. In the past twenty years, we've made more revolutionary tech than the hundred years previous; this has made a huge impact on the way we live our lives on a daily basis. Computers and networks form the most basic parts of businesses nowadays snf it's become essential to be at the very least computer literate to find a place in business. Building a business by definition should be accepting innovation as a part pf your model and collective ethos.  </p>

      <h2>How My Chosen Technologies Have Impacted My Outcome</h2>
      <div>
        <p>For my project, the main tools I have used have been Visual Studio Code, GitHub and Trello.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have used HTML to build the content of my site and found it to be a very accessible language, especially as it was very easy to view and keep track of the changes I had made to my site, simply by opening the file in my browser. Though HTML can be used in a notepad, making it even easier to employ, I decided to use Visual Studio Code to help me keep good editing practice and find out where my mistakes were, as I hadn't used much HTML before. This was definitely useful, as it was easy to keep track of what piece of code meant what as everything was clearly labelled. However, as Visual Studio Code autofills the majority of commands, it led to me being a little lazy, as I knew I could simply search for the term I was looking for. This is why I think in the case of HTML, Visual Studio Code is a good method of revising code but not necessarily writing it. In the end, I have managed to come out with a neat looking site when it comes to the content, which is all I ever needed from HTML, so I am satisfied with my code.
        </p> 
        <p>  
            GitHub would be useful in tracking changes in my site, but as I was just using HTML, it didn't seem 100% necessary to track all the changes, as all I was doing was beefing up the page with content. I think this will be more useful when I start to implement CSS and JavaScript as there is a lot more that can go wrong and it will be essential for me to be able to figure out those problems. 
        </p>  
        <p> 
            Lastly, making a Trello board and employing Kanban principles made my life so much easier, as those easily digestable tasks didn't seem as daunting as simply "build a website". Having columns to represents what needs doing, what's in progress and what's done has really increased my productivity. Those clear stages from inception to finished project are visible within my site and makes it that much more digestible.</p>
