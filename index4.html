            <h2>The Ongoing Use of IT Tools</h2>
            <div>
            <p>
                As stated earlier, I am using Visual Studio Code, GitHub and Trello as my main IT tools. They have been serving me well, now that I have made several commits, I have found more use for GitHub. However, I'm using both GitHub and Visual Studio Code in a very basic manner so I doubt I am seeing their full potential or have used them enough to find any real flaws. I will say that it is easier to keep track of code in Visual Studio Code than in Notepad, but I think I could use either if I really tried. I have previously used Sublime Text for Python and I think that I will continue to use both code editors. As for Trello, it has been a consistently useful tool and I have found the labelling, colour coding and cross-referencing essential to work at my optimal organisational capacity. I haven't made many changes, other than an increased use of GitHub as the project went on.</p>

            <h2>Were These Tools Appropriate?</h2>  
            <div>
                    <p>The tools I used were definitely fit for purpose and I had no problem using them. They were user-friendly, intuitive and I didn't encounter any problems other than user error. Now that I know more about these tools, I think it will be even easier to employ them in the future. However, I will continue to research other tools, as innovations in tech can often lead to increased productivity.</p>

        <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
        <div>
                <p>My final website has a few different elements present and I have learnt a lot about using HTML and CSS to build a site. It's clear and the background and main fonts for large bodies of text are dyslexia friendly, which was something I considered beforehand. My imaged are properly sourced and credited and it's easy to navigate through with the sticky nav bar. However, I would say that it isn't exactly a beautiful site, as it's very basic. But due to my skill set, this was necessary to produce a functional site within the designated time frame. In time, I would like to add Flexbox functionality to my site and also add some javascript, so that I can add some things like a working contact form or a gallery. Overall, I am happy with my end product, but I am ready to learn more and add to my site.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Further Improvements</h2>
        <div>
                <p>As mentioned earlier, I'd like to add Flexbox functionality to my site. I'd use this to wrap my sections into easier to digest chunks that would translate to different devices easily. Also, I would like to add a contact form that would link to an email service, but I think this would take a lot more time and learning.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Benefits and Drawbacks of Tools Used</h2>
        <div>
                <p>Every tool I used, I found helpful in some capacity. However, due to the small scale of this project, I felt that I didn't use tools enough to find their drawbacks. This being said, it could pose some huge problems if you were using a tool and then a good way into your project you found a huge flaw. For this reason, it may be useful to research tools thoroughly to ensure that you won't run into a trap later on.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Methods to Improve Productivity</h2>
        <div>
                <p>Personally, I work best when I can link tools to my personal calendar and reminder apps. This is fairly easy to do and something I will do for future projects.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Tools to Improve Productivity</h2>
        <div>
                <p>If I were to do this task again, I would do this as part of a team. This is where Trello and GitHub are most useful as you could designate tasks and see edits really easily. Then, we could have the added bonus of using tools like Slack and integrating things like Trello into Slack for ease of access.

        <h2>Testing Digital Solutions</h2>
        <div>
                <p>Software testing would be the most efficient way to make sure my website is in working order. As this project really relied on having correct code and obviously a lot of human error can happen, I feel that the best way to test things would be unit testing, where small sections of code (eg functions) are tested on their own. This would really hone in on the problems, and as it's a relatively small project, wouldn't take a massively long time.</p>
