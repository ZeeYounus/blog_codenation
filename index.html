            </div>

            <div>
                <p>In school, I had always loved maths and IT, so in college I decided to study Software Development. However, the environment and culture were very competitive and hostile and being one of two women, I felt out of place. After one year, I quit and I only realised why this year. I didn't think I'd have another opportunity to pursue a career in tech, having completed an undergraduate degree in a humanities subject, but then I signed up a Django Girls event at Code Nation and a whole host of opportunities became available. Now, I'm more confident than I was and eager to prove that there is a place for me in the world of software development!</p>

                <h2>My Interest in Technology and Coding</h2>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>I consider myself both analytical/logical and creative in equal measures, and I feel that coding is a perfect marriage of the two. Throughout my life, I have been an avid gamer and tech head, in awe of how these devices worked. However, I've spent a good portion of the last few years dabbling in graphic design and therefore, I feel that front end development or games development would be a perfect route for me to follow.</p>
